		<div class="body col1">Developed for Netscape 2, LOVE is a series of seven stories arranged in a navigable grid of HTML files. Images, text, and interactive compositions map a range of experiences associated with romantic love, from innocent longing to polymorphous perversion to bitter loss. The user navigates the work via a nonlinear path, but the work retains a loose narrative arc nevertheless.</div>

		<div class="body col2">With its lyrical, expressive vignettes arranged in a precise grid, LOVE exemplifies the structural possibilities afforded by the web. In a seeming paradox, the standardization that is characteristic of the computer and the network continuously opens up new spaces for improvisation and experimentation, for emotional experience, and for artistic play.</div>

		<div class="body col1">The grid of pages in LOVE can be thought of as a kind of basic database, from which the user can construct their own narrative through navigation. Navigation is spatialized, with the user clicking on arrows to move up, down, left, or right, as if moving through a videogame landscape. Though the user may take a nonlinear pathway through the work, most pathways begin with an interactive flower and concludes with the final frame of a cinematic love story.</div>

		<div class="body col2">The work draws on Samyn's own experiences, including snippets of letters from past relationships. In the text accompanying the initial piece, Samyn was careful to point out that although the work aimed to address the topic of “love” in a general sense, it did so from a particular, heterosexual point of view.</div>
